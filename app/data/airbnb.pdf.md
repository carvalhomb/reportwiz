**Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, about us and our industry that
involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding
our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management, and expected market growth, are forward-looking statements.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “shall,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,”
“target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “goal,” “objective,” “seeks,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or
expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to,
statements about:

-  the effects of macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, high unemployment, and foreign currency fluctuations, on the

demand for travel or similar experiences;

-  the effects of fluctuations in demand for host homes, including lower demand in certain areas or as a result of oversupply in others;

-  the effects of supply constraints on availability of host homes;

-  our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests;

-  our ability to effectively manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

-  the impact of the ongoing armed conflicts around the world on our business;

-  our expectations regarding our financial performance, including our revenue, costs, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, and Free Cash

Flow;

-  our expectations regarding future operating performance, including Nights and Experiences Booked, Gross Booking Value (“GBV”), Average Daily Rate, and GBV per Night

and Experience Booked;

-  our ability to compete in our industry;

-  our expectations regarding the resilience of our model, including in areas such as domestic travel, short-distance travel, travel outside of top cities, and long-term stays;

-  our ability to stay in compliance with laws and regulations that currently apply or may become applicable to our business, both in the United States and internationally, and

our expectations regarding various laws and restrictions that relate to our business;

-  seasonality and the effects of seasonal trends on our results of operations;

-  our expectations regarding the impact of our marketing strategy, and our ability to continue to attract guests and hosts to our platform through direct and unpaid channels;

-  anticipated trends, developments, and challenges in our industry, business, and the highly competitive markets in which we operate;

-  our ability to anticipate market needs or develop new or enhanced offerings and services to meet those needs;

-  our ability to manage expansion into international markets and new businesses;

-  laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental, long-term rental, and home sharing business that have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness

of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant fees or penalties;

-  the impact on our income as a result of the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;

-  our expectations regarding lodging tax obligations and other non-income tax matters;

-  our expectations regarding our income tax liabilities, including anticipated increases in foreign taxes, valuation allowances, and the adequacy of our reserves;

-  our expectations regarding settlement discussions related to tax audits;

-  our expectations regarding the impact of the recently enacted Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax;

-  our ability to effectively manage our growth and expand our infrastructure and our ability to maintain our corporate culture, and our employee initiatives;

-  the safety, affordability, and convenience of our platform and our offerings;

-  our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us;

-  the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments to meet our liquidity needs;

-  our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; and

-  our ability to make required payments under our credit agreement and to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness.

We caution you that the foregoing list does not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should not rely upon forward-looking
statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations,
estimates, forecasts, and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Although we
believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of
activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. The outcome of the events described in these forwardlooking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Risks that contribute to the uncertain nature of the forward-looking statements include, among others, the
Company’s ability to retain existing hosts and guests and add new hosts and guests; any decline or disruption in the travel and hospitality industries or economic downturn; the
Company’s ability to compete successfully; changes to the laws and regulations that may limit hosts’ ability and willingness to provide their listings, and/or result in significant fines,
liabilities, and penalties to the Company; the effect of extensive regulation and oversight, litigation, and other proceedings related to the Company’s business in a variety of areas;
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, including as a result of new strains or variants of the virus, the travel industry, travel trends, and the global
economy generally; the Company’s ability to maintain its brand and reputation, and effectively drive traffic to its platform; the effectiveness of the Company’s strategy and business
initiatives, including measures to improve trust and safety; the Company’s operations in international markets; the Company’s indebtedness; the Company’s final closing procedures,
final adjustments, and other developments that may arise in the course of audit and review procedures; and changes in political, business, and economic conditions; as well as other
risks listed or described from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it
is not possible for us to predict all risks and


-----

uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the
forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made available. We undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed
in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of
any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us
as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or
incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These
statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by these cautionary statements.

# Airbnb, Inc.

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)**

**Note 1. Description of Business**

Airbnb, Inc. (the “Company” or “Airbnb”) was incorporated in Delaware in June 2008 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The Company operates a global platform for
unique stays and experiences. The Company’s marketplace model connects hosts and guests (collectively referred to as “customers”) online or through mobile devices to book
spaces and experiences around the world.

**Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding interim financial information. Certain information
and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related
notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. The results for the
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Certain immaterial amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period
presentation.

In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are
necessary for the fair statement of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for these interim periods.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in accordance with consolidation
accounting guidance. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates its
estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, fair value of investments, useful lives of long-lived assets and intangible assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
from acquisitions, contingent liabilities, insurance reserves, revenue recognition, valuation of common stock, stock-based compensation, and income and non-income taxes, among
others. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

As the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their
effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require increased judgment. These estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as new events occur and additional information becomes known. To the extent the Company’s actual results differ materially
from those estimates and assumptions, the Company’s future unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements could be affected.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Standards_**

In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance related to the fair value measurement of an equity security subject to contractual sale
restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity security. The new guidance also introduced new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions
that are measured at fair value. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2024. There was no impact to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements upon adoption.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted_**

In December 2023, the FASB issued an update which expands income tax disclosure in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the
U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The update is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the
update retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements other than the expanded footnote disclosure.

In November 2023, the FASB issued an update to improve disclosure of reportable segments on an annual and interim basis, primarily through enhanced disclosures about
significant segment expenses. The update is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15,
2024, on a retrospective basis with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on its unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements other than the expanded footnote disclosure.

There are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, and the Company does not believe any of these
accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt securities for which the Company recorded credit-related losses.

Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax before reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) to other expense, net were not material for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and 2024. Realized gains and losses reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.

Debt securities in an unrealized loss position had an estimated fair value of $777 million and $1.1 billion, and unrealized losses of $16 million and $18 million as of December 31,
2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. A total of $283 million and $479 million of these securities, with unrealized losses of $14 million and $16 million, were in a continuous
unrealized loss position for more than twelve months as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

There were no material changes in unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income relating to investments measured at fair value for which the Company has utilized
Level 3 inputs to determine fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.

There were no transfers of financial instruments into or out of Level 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.

**Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging**

The Company has a portion of its business denominated and transacted in foreign currencies, which subjects the Company to foreign exchange risk, and uses derivative instruments
to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain
exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

To protect revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts, or other instruments, and may designate
these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue, for up to 18 months.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses
generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

To limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the
Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of March 31, 2024, the potential effect of these rights of off-set associated
with the Company’s derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets and liabilities of $15 million, resulting in net derivative assets of $22 million.

The effect of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations was not material for the three months
ended March 31, 2024.

_Cash flow hedges_

The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024,
respectively.

As of March 31, 2024, approximately $16 million of deferred net gains on both outstanding and matured derivatives in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to revenue during the
next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions which will be recorded in revenue. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to revenue are dependent on the
exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature.

_Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments_

The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $2.4 billion and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024,
respectively.

**Note 7. Debt**

**_Convertible Senior Notes_**

In 2021, the Company issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") pursuant to an indenture, dated March 8, 2021 (the
"Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.

As of both December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, total outstanding debt, net of unamortized debt discount and debit issuance costs, was $2.0 billion. Interest expense was
immaterial for both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.

As of March 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2026 Notes did not exceed the outstanding principal amount.

As of March 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the 2026 Notes was $1.9 billion and was determined based on a market approach using actual bids and offers of the 2026
Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period, or Level 2 inputs.

**_2022 Credit Facility_**

In 2022, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, which provides for initial commitments by a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc. of $1.0 billion (“2022 Credit Facility”). The 2022 Credit Facility provides a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit.

The 2022 Credit Facility contains customary events of default, affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to
incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes, as well as certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2024.

As of March 31, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the 2022 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled $25 million.

**Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Commitments_**

The Company has commitments including purchase obligations for web-hosting services and other commitments for brand marketing. As of March 31, 2024, there were no material
changes outside the ordinary course of business to the Company’s commitments, as disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**_Lodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters_**

**_Platform Related Taxes and Collection Obligations_**

Some states and localities in the United States and elsewhere in the world impose transient occupancy or lodging accommodations taxes (“Lodging Taxes”) on the use or occupancy
of lodging accommodations or other traveler services. As of March 31, 2024, the Company collects and remits Lodging Taxes in approximately 33,000 jurisdictions on behalf of its
hosts. Such Lodging Taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a 30 to 90-day period following the end of each month.

As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the Company had an obligation to remit Lodging Taxes collected from guests on bookings in these jurisdictions totaling $274 million
and $508 million, respectively. These payables were recorded in accrued expenses, accounts payable, and other current liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

In jurisdictions where the Company does not collect and remit Lodging Taxes, hosts are primarily responsible for such taxes. The Company has estimated Lodging Tax liabilities in a
certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes where management believes it is probable that the Company can be held jointly liable with hosts for taxes
and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, accrued obligations related to these estimated taxes, including estimated
penalties and interest, totaled $114 million and $124 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to certain Lodging
Taxes that can be determined in excess of the amounts accrued is between $38 million to $48 million; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company
could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. With respect to all other jurisdictions’ Lodging Taxes for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is
unable to determine an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued.

The Company’s potential obligations with respect to Lodging Taxes could be affected by various factors, which include, but are not limited to, whether the Company determines or
any tax authority asserts that the Company has a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historical or future transactions, or by the introduction of new ordinances
and taxes that subject the Company’s operations to such taxes. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of Lodging Taxes may be greater or less than the reserve amounts that the
Company has recorded.

The Company is currently involved in disputes brought by certain domestic and international states and localities involving the payment of Lodging Taxes. These jurisdictions are
asserting that the Company is liable or jointly liable with hosts to collect and remit Lodging Taxes. These disputes are in various stages and the Company continues to vigorously
defend these claims. The Company believes that the statutes

15


-----

**Table of Contents**

# Airbnb, Inc.

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)**

at issue impose a Lodging Tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, or the Company’s hosts.

The imposition of such taxes on the Company could increase the cost of a guest booking and potentially cause a reduction in the volume of bookings on the Company’s platform,
which would adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. The Company will continue to monitor the application and interpretation of lodging and related taxes and
ordinances and will adjust accruals based on any new information or further developments.

The Company is under audit and inquiry by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities
primarily arises from the Company’s transactions with its customers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with
disputes connected to transactions with customers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value-added, and similar taxes) to services provided, as
well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such hosts. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the Company accrued a total of $521 million and $428
million of estimated tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to hosts’ withholding tax obligations, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company estimates that the
reasonably possible loss related to withholding income taxes that can be determined in excess of the amounts accrued is between $95 million to $115 million; however, no
assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters
and judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcomes may exceed the estimated liabilities recorded.

The Company has identified reasonably possible exposures related to transactional taxes and business taxes and has not accrued for these amounts since the likelihood of the
contingent liability is less than probable. As of March 31, 2024, the Company estimates that the reasonably possible loss related to these matters in excess of the amounts accrued
is between $320 million and $340 million; however, no assurance can be given as to the outcomes and the Company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

In 2017, Italy passed a law purporting to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst
other obligations (“2017 Law”). The Company challenged this law before the Italian courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). In December 2022, the CJEU
found that European law does not prohibit member states from passing legislation requiring short-term rental platforms to withhold income taxes from their hosts, however a
requirement to appoint a tax representative, on which the 2017 Law and the withholding obligations are based, is contrary to European Union (“EU”) law. In October 2023, the Italian
national court upheld the ruling of the CJEU. The Company’s subsidiary in Italy and subsidiary in Ireland continue to be, or could be in the future, subject to tax audits in Italy,
including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, and withholding obligations.

In May 2023, the Guardia di Finanza de Milano (“GdF”) issued a Tax Audit Report recommending to the Italian tax authorities a formal tax assessment of 779 million Euro on Airbnb’s
subsidiary in Ireland relating to the 2017 Law and associated withholding tax obligations. On December 13, 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement
with the Italian Revenue Agency (“ITA”) in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit period for an aggregate payment of 576 million Euro ($621 million). Such agreement settles a dispute
about Airbnb Ireland’s obligations to withhold and remit host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. The GdF conducted a withholding tax
audit of Airbnb Ireland UC for the 2022 and 2023 tax years and issued a report to the ITA in March 2024. The Company expects to begin settlement discussions with the ITA in the
second quarter 2024.

With respect to all other withholding tax on payments made to hosts and transactional taxes for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to determine
an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued.

**_Payroll Taxes_**

The Company is subject to regular payroll tax examinations by various international, state and local jurisdictions. Although management believes its tax withholding remittance
practices are appropriate, the Company may be subject to additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, if any tax authority disagrees with the Company’s withholding and
remittance practices, or if there are changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles or interpretations related to payroll tax withholding in the various international,
state and local jurisdictions.

In addition, as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the Company accrued a total of $43 million and $45 million of estimated tax liabilities related to employment taxes on
certain employee benefits, respectively.

**_Legal and Regulatory Matters_**

The Company has been and is currently a party to various legal and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business. Such proceedings and claims, even if not
meritorious, can require significant financial and operational resources, including the diversion of management’s attention from the Company’s business objectives.

**_Regulatory Matters_**

The Company operates in a complex legal and regulatory environment and its operations are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related
to: Internet activities; short-term rentals, long-term rentals and home sharing; real estate, property rights, housing and land use; travel and hospitality; privacy and data protection;
intellectual property; competition; health and safety; protection of minors; consumer protection; employment; payments, money transmission, economic and trade sanctions, anticorruption and anti-bribery; taxation; and others. In addition, the nature of the Company’s business exposes it to inquiries and potential claims related to the compliance of the
business with applicable law and regulations. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being applied, interpreted or implemented to address
aspects of the Company’s business, and such adoption or interpretation could

16


-----

**Table of Contents**

# Airbnb, Inc.

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)**

further alter or impact the Company’s business.

In certain instances, the Company has been party to litigation with municipalities relating to or arising out of certain regulations. In addition, the implementation and enforcement of
regulation can have an impact on the Company’s business.

_Intellectual Property_

The Company has been and is currently subject to claims relating to intellectual property, including alleged patent infringement. Adverse results in such lawsuits may include awards
of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing the Company from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and
may also cause the Company to change its business practices or require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise
harm its business. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such cases and has not recorded any material liabilities in its consolidated financial
statements related to such matters.

_Litigation and Other Legal Proceedings_

The Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. These
include proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing,
discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property rights.

Depending on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, the Company may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, and/or injunctive orders.
Furthermore, the outcome of these matters could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal
proceedings, claims, and government investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such
matters. While it is not possible to determine the outcomes, the Company believes based on its current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals represent
management’s best estimate of probable losses. Such currently accrued amounts are not material to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
However, management’s views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and the matters continue to develop. Until
the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to losses in excess of the amounts accrued. With respect to outstanding legal matters, based on current knowledge,
the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations,
financial condition, or cash flows. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

**_Host Protections_**

The Company offers AirCover coverage, which includes but is not limited to, the Company’s Host Damage Protection program that provides protection of up to $3 million for direct
physical loss or damage to a host’s covered property caused by guests during a confirmed booking and when the host and guest are unable to resolve the dispute. The
Company retains risk and also maintains insurance from third parties on a per claim basis to protect the Company’s financial exposure under this program. In addition, through thirdparty insurers and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, the Company provides insurance coverage for third-party bodily injury or
property damage liability claims that occur during a stay. The Company’s Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance consists of a commercial general liability policy,
with hosts and the Company as named insureds and landlords of hosts as additional insureds. The Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance provides primary
coverage for up to $1 million per occurrence, subject to a $1 million cap per listing location, and includes various market standard conditions, limitations, and exclusions.

**_Indemnifications_**

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with certain of its employees, officers and directors. The indemnification agreements and the Company’s Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers and those employees who have entered into indemnification agreements to the fullest
extent not prohibited by Delaware law. Subject to certain limitations, the indemnification agreements and Bylaws also require the Company to advance expenses incurred by its
directors and officers and those employees who have entered into indemnification agreements. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification or
advancement under the indemnification agreements or the Bylaws, and thus, there are no indemnification or advancement claims that the Company is aware of that could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has included limited indemnification provisions in certain agreements with parties with whom the Company has commercial
relations, which provisions are of varying scope and terms with respect to indemnification of certain matters, which may include losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such
agreements or out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions
due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been
incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with the Company’s indemnification provisions.

**Note 10. Income Taxes**

The Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined by using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter. In each quarter, the
Company updates the estimated annual effective tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the provision. The estimated annual effective tax rate is subject to significant
volatility due to several factors, including accurately predicting the Company’s pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany
transactions, audit-related developments, and changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative actions.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $13 million and $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, which were primarily driven by current
and deferred tax on U.S. and foreign earnings, the accrual of interest on certain uncertain tax positions, and the income tax benefit from excess tax benefits on stock-based
compensation arising during the quarter.

The Company’s significant tax jurisdictions include the United States, California, and Ireland. The Company is currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) for the 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. The primary issue under examination in the 2013 audit is the valuation of the Company’s international intellectual
property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2019, new information became available which required the Company to remeasure its reserve for
unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded additional tax expense of $196 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. In December 2020, the Company received a
Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) from the IRS which proposed an increase to the Company’s U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and
cash liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds its current reserve recorded in its consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. The Company
disagrees with the proposed adjustment and continues to vigorously contest it. In February 2021, the Company submitted a protest to the IRS describing its disagreement with the
proposed adjustment and requesting the case be transferred to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“IRS Appeals”). In December 2021, the Company received a rebuttal from
the IRS with the same proposed adjustments that were in the NOPA. In January 2022, the Company entered into an administrative dispute process with IRS Appeals. An acceptable
outcome is not expected to be reached with IRS Appeals, and the Company expects to receive a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS related to the aforementioned
valuation of its international intellectual property consistent with the previously received NOPA, claiming that the Company owes $1.3 billion in tax, plus penalties and interest. The
Company will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute, including petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) for redetermination, and if necessary, appealing
the Tax Court’s decision to the appropriate appellate court. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from
these examinations. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds the Company’s
current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could
require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flow.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax known as the Corporate Alternative
Minimum Tax (“CAMT”) on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act became effective beginning in
fiscal year 2023. The Company anticipates paying a material amount of additional federal taxes in 2024 due to the CAMT. The additional CAMT will result in tax credits that are
expected to offset the Company’s federal tax in subsequent years, thus there is no impact to the overall tax provision.

**_Share Repurchase Program_**

In May 2023 and February 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors approved share repurchase programs to purchase up to $2.5 billion and $6.0 billion of the
Company’s Class A common stock, respectively.

Share repurchases under these share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, such as open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block
trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions or by any combination of such methods. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic
conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. These share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares
and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock for $750 million, which completed
the repurchases authorized under the share repurchase program announced in May 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $6.0 billion available to repurchase shares of
Class A common stock under its share repurchase program.

**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements_
_and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for_
_the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the_
_section titled “Risk Factors” of our 2023 Annual Report. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future._

**Overview**

We are a community based on connection and belonging—a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since
grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 1.5 billion guest arrivals in almost every country and region across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and
experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

We have five stakeholders and we have designed our Company with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in
which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive.

**First Quarter Financial Highlights**

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue grew by 18% to $2.1 billion, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in Nights and
Experiences Booked of 11.5 million driving a 12% increase in Gross Booking Value (“GBV”) of $2.5 billion, a modest increase in Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), and the shift in timing of
Easter from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024. The growth in revenue demonstrated the continued strong travel demand.

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by 126% to $264 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by our revenue growth, increased
interest income, and discipline in managing our cost structure.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased 62% to $424 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, demonstrating the continued strength 1
of our business, a modest increase in ADR, and discipline in managing our cost structure.

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.6 billion, in the same period in the prior year. We
generated Free Cash Flow of $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.6 billion, in the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily 1
driven by growth in net income, and accrued expenses and other liabilities.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock for $750 million, leaving $6.0 billion available to repurchase under our
share repurchase program.

**Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

We track the following key business metrics and financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) (“non-GAAP financial measures”) to evaluate our operating performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic
decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and
evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to
investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP
financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results.

These key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial
information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of each nonGAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided under the subsection titled “— Adjusted EBITDA
Reconciliation” and “— Free Cash Flow Reconciliation” below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these nonGAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

**_Nights and Experiences Booked_**

Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a
period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in
that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking were
canceled on

GAAP Financial Measures— Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” and “— Free Cash Flow Reconciliation” below.

**Table of Contents**

May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with
one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is
booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key
business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of
transaction on our platform.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had 132.6 million Nights and Experiences Booked, a 9.5% increase from 121.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The
increase was driven by growth across all regions, with the strongest growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as we continue to focus on international expansion.

**_Gross Booking Value_**

GBV represents the dollar value of bookings on our platform in a period and is inclusive of host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees, and taxes, net of cancellations and alterations
that occurred during that period. The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled “— Key Business Metrics and NonGAAP Financial Measures — Nights and Experiences Booked” above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue.
The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our
Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our GBV was $22.9 billion, a 12% increase from $20.4 billion for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in Nights and Experiences Booked, combined with a modest increase in ADR. We saw GBV growth across all regions, with the strongest growth in Latin America and Asia
Pacific.

**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**

Our non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, which are described below. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most
directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP is provided below. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and
the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure,
should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these
limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow has
limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by
operating activities. Free Cash Flow does not reflect our ability to meet future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting
its usefulness as a comparative measure.

(1) Stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of

our compensation strategy.

The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because they are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not
driven by core results of operations, and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $162 million to $424 million and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased from 14% to 20% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the
same period in the prior year. The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were primarily driven by the continued strength in our business, a modest
increase in ADR, and discipline in managing our cost structure.

**Free Cash Flow Reconciliation**

The following is a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most comparable U.S. GAAP cash flow measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions, except
percentages):


**Three Months Ended**

**March 31,**

**2023** **2024**

Revenue $ 1,818 $ 2,142

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,587 $ 1,923

Purchases of property and equipment (6) (14)

Free Cash Flow $ 1,581 $ 1,909

Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue 87 % 89 %

Other cash flow components:
Net cash used in investing activities $ (183) $ (84)

Net cash provided by financing activities $ 2,286 $ 2,134

Our Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held
on behalf of our customers and amounts payable to our customers do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. The increase in Free Cash Flow for the
three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by growth in net income, and accrued expenses and other liabilities.

**Seasonality**

Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In a typical year, the first, second, and third quarters have higher Nights and
Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and EMEA.

Our key business metrics, including GBV and Adjusted EBITDA, can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is
generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in
the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. A
significant portion of our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second
quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees typically make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue
the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees, a
lower sequential decrease in Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically lower.

**Three Months Ended**

**March 31,**

**2023** **2024** **% Change**

(in millions, except percentages)

Provision for income taxes $ 13 $ 29 123 %

The provision for income taxes increased primarily due to increased profitability, additional deferred tax expense resulting from last year’s valuation allowance release on our U.S.
deferred tax assets and the utilization of some of those assets in the current year, the accrual of interest on certain uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the income tax benefit
from excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation arising during the quarter.

In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar
solution to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation, known to as Pillar One and a 15% global minimum effective tax rate, known as Pillar Two. On December 15, 2022, the
EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s global minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules.
The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new
tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and concluded there was no
material impact to our tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future reporting periods.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Sources and Conditions of Liquidity_**

As of March 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $11.1 billion. As of March 31, 2024, cash and cash
equivalents totaled $7.8 billion, which included $2.2 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts and highlyliquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. As of March 31, 2024, short-term investments totaled $3.3 billion. Short-term investments primarily consist of highly-liquid
investment grade corporate debt securities, time deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government and government agency debt securities (“government bonds”),
and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These amounts do not include funds of $8.7 billion as of March 31, 2024, that we held for bookings in advance of guests
completing check-ins that we record separately on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a
corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers.

Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held at large global systemically important banks (or “G-SIBs”) which are subject to high capital requirements and are required to
regularly perform stringent stress tests related to their ability to absorb capital losses. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held outside the United States may be
repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. However, repatriation of such funds may result in additional tax
liabilities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances in the United States are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United
States.

We have access to $1.0 billion of commitments and a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2024, no amounts were
drawn under the 2022 Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled $25 million.

**_Material Cash Requirements_**

As of March 31, 2024, we had outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of our 0% convertible senior notes due in 2026. On March 3, 2021, in
connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers and other
financial institutions (the "option counterparties") at a cost of approximately $100 million. The cap price of the Capped Calls was $360.80 per share of Class A common stock, which
represented a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock of $180.40 per share on March 3, 2021, subject to certain customary adjustments
under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions.

**Table of Contents**

In February 2024, our board of directors approved an additional share repurchase program to purchase up to $6.0 billion of our Class A common stock. During the three months
ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 4.7 million shares of Class A common stock for $750 million through our share repurchase programs. As of March 31, 2024,
we had $6.0 billion available to repurchase shares of Class A common stock under our share repurchase program.

**Cash Flows**

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in millions):

**Three Months Ended March 31,**

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,587 $ 1,923

Net cash used in investing activities (183) (84)

Net cash provided by financing activities 2,286 2,134

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 79 (111)

Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 3,769 $ 3,862

|2023|2024|
|---|---|
|$ 1,587 (183) 2,286 79|$ 1,923 (84) 2,134 (111)|
|$ 3,769|$ 3,862|



Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.9 billion, which was primarily due to net income of $264 million, additional cash
provided by a $1.0 billion increase in unearned fees resulting from growth in bookings, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $325 million. Additionally, we had adjustments
for non-cash charges, primarily consisting of $295 million of stock-based compensation expense.

Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $84 million, which was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by
proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of short-term investments.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease in funds payable and amounts payable to
customers of $3.0 billion, partially offset by share repurchases of $750 million and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $155 million.

The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash
balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. For the three months ended March 31,
2024, we recorded a decrease of $111 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate
changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our hosts and guests.

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short- and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating
activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash
requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt
repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth,
headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund
our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash
flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked
arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business,
results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 3.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" in our 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of the assumptions and judgments involved in our critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

See Note 2, _Summary of Significant Accounting Policies_ , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

There have been no material changes in our market risk during the three months ended March 31, 2024. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A. " _Quantitative and_
_Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk_ " in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**

**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
March 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended March 31, 2024
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

**Limitations on Controls**

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired objectives. Management
does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our
company have been detected.

**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**

**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. These include
proceedings, claims, and investigations relating to, among other things, regulatory matters, commercial matters, intellectual property, competition, tax, employment, pricing,
discrimination, consumer rights, personal injury, and property rights. See Note 9, _Commitments and Contingencies,_ to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Depending on the nature of the proceeding, claim, or investigation, we may be subject to monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, or injunctive orders. Furthermore, the outcome
of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, and government
investigations are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant judgment to determine the likelihood and amount of loss related to such matters. While it is not possible to
determine the outcomes, we believe based on our current knowledge that the resolution of all such pending matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

**Item 1A. Risk Factors**

There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item IA of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual
Report”). Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties included in the Annual Report, together
with all of the other information in the Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, and other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The risks and uncertainties described in these reports may not be the only ones we face. The factors discussed in these reports, among others, could
cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press
releases, communications with investors, and oral statements.

**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**

**_Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities_**

$6.0 billion of our Class A common stock, respectively, at management’s discretion. The Company has repurchased the full amount of shares authorized for repurchase under
the May 2023 repurchase program. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date, do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may
be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion.

Appraisal Procedure is invoked. If within 30 days after appointment of the two appraisers they are unable to agree upon the amount in question,

stock (the “Stock Split”), and as a result, for value received [ ], or its permitted assigns (the “Warrantholder”) is entitled, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth herein, to acquire from the Corporation, in whole or in part, at any time after the date hereof, up to
an aggregate of [ ] fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A Common Stock at a purchase price per share of Class A Common Stock equal
to the Exercise Price. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Shares”) for which the Warrant is exercisable is subject to
adjustment as provided herein, and all references to “Class A Common Stock” and “Shares” herein shall be deemed to include any such
adjustment or series of adjustments. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an exercise of any portion of this Warrant is to be made in
connection with a Deemed Liquidation Event or other transaction by the Corporation, such exercise may at the election of the Warrantholder be
conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective until immediately prior
to the consummation of such transaction. The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that as of December 14, 2020, there has not occurred
any event of the type that would require an adjustment to the Exercise Price or the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
pursuant to Section 12 of the Warrant other than (1) the Stock Split and (2) any event in respect of which the applicable subsection of Section 12
of the Warrant has been waived in accordance with Section 18 of the Warrant.

3. Exercise of Warrant; Term.


(i) Subject to Section 2, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, the right to purchase the Shares

represented by this Warrant is exercisable, in whole or in part by the Warrantholder, at any time after the date hereof, but in no event later than
5:00 p.m., New York City time, April 17, 2030 (the “Expiration Time”), by (A) the surrender of this Warrant and Notice of Exercise annexed
hereto, duly completed and executed on behalf of the Warrantholder, at the principal executive office of the Corporation located at 888 Brannan
Street Suite 4 San Francisco, CA 94103 (or such other office or agency of the Corporation in the United States as it may designate by notice in
writing to the Warrantholder at the address of the Warrantholder appearing on the books of the Corporation), and (B) payment of the Exercise
Price in accordance with Section 3(ii).

(ii) The payment of the Exercise Price may be made, at the election of the Warrantholder, (A) by tendering in cash, by

certified or cashier’s check payable to the order of the Corporation, or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Corporation or (B) on a “cashless basis,” by surrendering Shares for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Shares surrendered, _multiplied by_ the difference between the Exercise Price and the Market
Price _by_ (b) the


-----

Market Price; provided, that, if the difference between the Exercise Price and the Market Price is equal to zero or a negative number ( _i.e._ , the
Exercise Price is greater than the Market Price), then the Warrant holder shall not be entitled to receive any Shares pursuant to a “cashless”
exercise in accordance with this Section 3(ii). [For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of clause (x) above, the phrase “number of Shares
surrendered” shall mean the number of Shares as to which this Warrant is so exercised.]

(iii) I f the Warrantholder does not exercise this Warrant in its entirety, the Warrantholder will be entitled to receive from the

Corporation within a reasonable time, and in any event not exceeding three business days, a new warrant in substantially identical form for the
purchase of that number of Shares equal to the difference between the number of Shares subject to this Warrant and the number of Shares as to
which this Warrant is so exercised. Notwithstanding anything in this Warrant to the contrary, the Warrantholder hereby acknowledges and agrees
that its exercise of this Warrant for Shares is subject to the condition that the Warrantholder will have first received any applicable Regulatory
Approvals.


4. Issuance of Shares; Authorization; Listing. Certificates for Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant will be issued in such

name or names, subject to compliance with Section 8, as the Warrantholder may designate and will be delivered to such named Person or
Persons within a reasonable time, not to exceed two Business Days after the date on which this Warrant has been duly exercised in accordance
with the terms of this Warrant. The Corporation hereby represents and warrants that any Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3 will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes,
liens and charges (other than liens or charges created by the Warrantholder, income and franchise taxes incurred by the Warrantholder in
connection with the exercise of the Warrant or taxes incurred by the Warrantholder in respect of any transfer of Shares occurring
contemporaneously therewith). The Corporation agrees that the Shares so issued will be deemed for all purposes to have been issued to the
Warrantholder as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant and payment of the Exercise Price are delivered to the Corporation in
accordance with the terms of this Warrant, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Corporation may then be closed or certificates
representing such Shares may not be actually delivered on such date. The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available, out of its
authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of providing for the exercise of this Warrant, the aggregate number of
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, and will not take or permit any action that would result in an increase in
the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant without first properly authorizing and reserving any additional shares of Class A
Common Stock necessary to comply with this Section 4. The Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Shares may be
issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation or of any requirement of any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or
traded, and, to the extent such Shares are listed or traded, to cause the Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, as soon as reasonably
practical after such exercise, to be listed on any such securities exchange. The Corporation and the Warrantholder will reasonably cooperate to
take such other actions as are necessary to obtain any Regulatory Approvals or other approvals or authorizations of any Governmental Entities
applicable to Warrantholder’s exercise of its rights hereunder, including those applicable to the Corporation with respect to the issuance of the
Shares. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to Section 12 to reduce the Exercise Price below the then par value
(if any) of the Class A Common Stock, the Corporation shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock at the
Exercise Price as so adjusted.


5. No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional Shares or scrip representing fractional Shares shall be issued upon any exercise of

this Warrant. In lieu of any fractional Share to which the Warrantholder would otherwise be entitled, the Warrantholder shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment equal to (i) the Market Price of one share of Class A Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the date of exercise
less the Exercise Price for one such share, multiplied by (ii) the relevant fraction.


-----

6. No Rights as Stockholders; Transfer Books. This Warrant does not entitle the Warrantholder to any voting rights or other rights

as a stockholder of the Corporation prior to the date of exercise hereof. The Corporation will at no time close its transfer books in any manner
which interferes with the timely exercise of this Warrant.


7. Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance of certificates for Shares to the Warrantholder upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be

made without charge to the Warrantholder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates,
all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Corporation.

8. Transfer/Assignment.


(i) Subject to compliance with clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 8, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable,

in whole or in part, by the registered holder hereof in person or by duly authorized attorney. Following any transfer that is permissible in
accordance with the Transfer Restrictions Agreements, the Warrantholder shall provide the Corporation notice thereof and, if the Warrantholder
requests, a new warrant shall be made and delivered by the Corporation, of the same tenor and date as this Warrant but registered in the name of
one or more transferees, upon surrender of this Warrant, duly endorsed, to the office or agency of the Corporation described in Section 3. All
expenses (other than stock transfer taxes) and other charges payable in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the new
warrants pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid by the Corporation.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Warrant and all rights hereunder, and any Shares issued upon

exercise of this Warrant, are subject to the applicable restrictions on transfer and other provisions as set forth in the Transfer Restrictions
Agreements, which TAO Finance 1, LLC, TCS Finance (A), LLC, Redwood IV Finance 1, LLC, TCS Finance 1, LLC and the Corporation
executed and delivered in connection with the issuance of the Original Warrants.


(iii) If and for so long as required by the Transfer Restrictions Agreements, this Warrant and any Shares issued upon exercise

of this Warrant shall contain a legend in the form required by and as set forth in the Transfer Restrictions Agreements.


9. Exchange and Registry of Warrant. This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Warrantholder to the

Corporation and without payment of any charge, for a new warrant or warrants of like tenor and representing the right to purchase the same
aggregate number of Shares. The Corporation shall maintain a registry showing the name and address of the Warrantholder as the registered
holder of this Warrant. This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange or exercise, in accordance with its terms, at the office of the Corporation,
and the Corporation shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry.


10. Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant. Upon receipt by the Corporation of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of

the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of a bond, indemnity
or security reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the
Corporation shall make and deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing the
right to purchase the same aggregate number of Shares as provided for in such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant.


11. Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required

or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day that is a
Business Day.

12. Adjustments and Other Rights. The Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be

subject to adjustment from time to time as follows; provided, that if more than one subsection of this Section 12 is applicable to a single event
and the application of more than one subsection would result in duplication of the appropriate adjustment from such event, the Adjustment
Notice (as defined below) shall so indicate and the Warrantholder shall elect by written notice


-----

to the Corporation which subsection of this Section 12 shall apply, with the Corporation and the Warrantholder bound by the Warrantholder’s
election:


(i) Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Reclassifications or Combinations. If the Corporation shall (i) declare and pay a dividend or

make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into
a greater number of shares or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such
subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Warrantholder, effective as of the close of business on
such date, shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of Common Stock which such holder would have
owned or been entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant after such date had this Warrant been
exercised immediately prior to such date. In such event, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or
distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the
product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment and (2) the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to the record or effective date, as the case may be, for the dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification
giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant determined pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence.

(ii) Certain Issuances of Common Shares or Convertible Securities. If the Corporation shall issue shares of Common Stock

(or rights or warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable (collectively, a “conversion”) for shares of Common
Stock) (collectively, “convertible securities”) (other than in a Permitted Transaction or a transaction to which subsection (i) of this Section 12 is
applicable) at a price per share (or having a conversion or exercise price per share) that is less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to such issuance of such shares (or such convertible securities) (the “Pre-Issuance Exercise Price”) then, in such event, (A) there shall be
calculated a fraction (I) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock of the Corporation outstanding on such date and (y) the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued (or into which
convertible securities may be exercised or convert) and (II) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding on such date and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration receivable by the Corporation
for the total number of shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which convertible securities may be exercised or convert) would purchase at
the Pre-Issuance Exercise Price (such fraction, the “Adjustment Factor”); and (B) the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of the Warrant shall
be adjusted by multiplying such Pre-Issuance Exercise Price by the Adjustment Factor. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment shall be
implemented under this subsection unless the Adjustment Factor is less than 1.0. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, all shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options (as defined in the Restated Certificate) outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or upon
conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (as defined in the Restated Certificate) (including the Preferred Stock (as defined in the
Restated Certificate)) outstanding(assuming exercise of any outstanding Options (as defined in the Restated Certificate) therefor) immediately
prior to such issuance shall be treated as outstanding shares of Common Stock.


For purposes of the foregoing, (a) “Permitted Transactions” shall mean issuances of Exempted Securities; and (b) in the case of the

issuance of shares of Common Stock or convertible securities without consideration, the consideration shall be deemed to be the par value per
share of Class A Common Stock. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 12(ii) shall become effective immediately upon the date of such
issuance.


Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised, unconverted or unexchanged convertible security (or portion thereof) the

issuance of which resulted in an adjustment pursuant to this Section


-----

12(ii), the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be recalculated assuming such convertible
security (or portion thereof) had never been issued and such adjustment so recalculated shall become effective immediately upon the date of such
expiration or termination.

(iii) Other Distributions. In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of

shares of its Common Stock of securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants (excluding dividends or distributions
referred to in Section 12(i)), in each such case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced immediately thereafter to
the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the
Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades without the right to receive such distribution,
minus the amount of cash or publicly traded securities or the Fair Market Value of any non-publicly traded securities, evidences of indebtedness,
assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of one share of Common Stock (the “Per Share Fair Market Value”) divided by (y) such
Market Price on such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. In such
event, the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of
(1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price and the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
then in effect shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of
indebtedness, assets, rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price that would then be in effect and the number of Shares that
would then be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant if such record date had not been fixed.

(iv) Certain Repurchases of Common Stock. In case the Corporation effects a Pro Rata Repurchase of Common Stock, then

the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the effective date of
such Pro Rata Repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately before such Pro Rata Repurchase and (y) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the first public announcement by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (ii) the
aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, and of which the denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the
Market Price per share of Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Corporation or any of
its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant shall be adjusted to the number obtained by dividing (x) the product of (1) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant before such adjustment, and (2) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this adjustment
by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(v) Deemed Liquidation Event. In the event the Corporation is a party to any Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation

shall give the Warrantholder at least 10 days’ advance written notice (each, a “Transaction Notice”) of the anticipated date for such Deemed
Liquidation Event. If the Corporation has delivered a Transaction Notice and the Warrantholder has not elected to exercise


-----

this Warrant under Section 3 in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event, or if the Expiration Time is set to occur prior the
consummation of such Deemed Liquidation Event, then upon the effective date of, and immediately prior to, the consummation of such Deemed
Liquidation Event or immediately prior to such Expiration Time, as applicable, this Warrant shall be automatically deemed to be exercised in full
on a “cashless basis” pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3(ii) (provided, that the Market Price of one share of Class A Common Stock
shall be deemed to be equal to the applicable aggregate consideration in respect of one share of Class A Common Stock that is payable upon the
closing of such Deemed Liquidation Event (based on the amount of any such consideration in the form of cash or publicly traded securities and
the Fair Market Value of any such consideration in the form of non-publicly traded securities or other property or assets)); provided, that if, at
such time such applicable aggregate consideration in respect of one share of Class A Common Stock is less than the Exercise Price, then this
Warrant shall instead cease to be exercisable and shall terminate in full for no consideration.

(vi) Liquidation. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the

Corporation, or if any other dissolution of the Corporation by operation of law is effected, then each Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive
any applicable distributions with respect to its Warrant on an equal basis with the holders of Class A Common Stock, as if such Warrant had been
exercised immediately prior to such event, less the aggregate applicable Exercise Price. Nothing in this subsection (vi) shall have the effect of
requiring a Warrantholder to make any actual payment to the Corporation.

(vii) Certain Events. If any event of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 12 but not expressly provided for

by such provisions occurs, then the Corporation shall make an appropriate adjustment in the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant so as to protect the rights of the Warrantholder in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 12; provided, that no such
adjustment pursuant to this Section 12(vii) shall decrease the number of Shares issuable pursuant to this Warrant.

(viii) Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments. All calculations under this Section 12 shall be made to the nearest

one-tenth (1/10th) of a cent or to the nearest one-hundred thousandth (1/100,000th) of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Section
12 to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable shall be
made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than the greater of $0.01 or one-ten thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share of Class A Common
Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any
subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or
1/10,000th of a share of Class A Common Stock, or more.

(ix) Timing of Issuance of Additional Class A Common Stock Upon Certain Adjustments. In any case in which the

provisions of this Section 12 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event, the Corporation
may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Warrantholder of this Warrant exercised after such record date and before the
occurrence of such event the additional shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by
such event over and above the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii)
paying to such Warrantholder any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Class A Common Stock; provided, however, that the
Corporation upon request shall deliver to such Warrantholder a due bill or other


-----

appropriate instrument evidencing such Warrantholder’s right to receive such additional shares, and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event
requiring such adjustment.

(x) Statement Regarding Adjustments. Whenever the Exercise Price or the number of Shares into which this Warrant is

exercisable shall be adjusted as provided in Section 12, the Corporation shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Corporation a statement
showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the number of Shares or type of
other securities or property into which this Warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment, and the Corporation shall also cause a copy of
such statement to be provided to each Warrantholder in the manner described in Section 19.

(xi) Notice of Adjustment Event. In the event that the Corporation shall (x) propose to take any action of the type described

in this Section 12 (but only if the action of the type described in this Section 12 would result in an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number
of Shares into which this Warrant is exercisable or a change in the type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of this Warrant),
the Corporation shall in any such case give prior written notice (an “Adjustment Notice”) to the Warrantholder, in the manner set forth in Section
19, which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action, the approximate date on which such action is to take place,
and a description of such action in reasonable detail. Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably
necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be
deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant. In the case of any such action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be
given at least 10 days prior to the date so fixed (provided that, with respect to any applicable stock split, subdivision, reclassification of
combination described in Section 12(i), such notice shall be given on the date so fixed), and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given
at least 10 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or
validity of any such action.

(xii) Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment. As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which

would require an adjustment pursuant to this Section 12, the Corporation shall take any action which may be necessary, including obtaining
regulatory, stock exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the Corporation may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully
paid and nonassessable all shares of Common Stock or other securities or property that the Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon exercise of
this Warrant pursuant to this Section 12.

(xiii) Adjustment Rules. Any adjustments pursuant to this Section 12 shall be made successively whenever an event referred

to herein shall occur. If an adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder would reduce the Exercise Price to an amount below par value of the
Class A Common Stock, then such adjustment in Exercise Price made hereunder shall reduce the Exercise Price to the par value of the Class A
Common Stock.

14. No Impairment. Except for any action that may be taken by the Corporation with the requisite consent of the Major Investors,

the Investors (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) and/or the Investors (as defined in the ROFR and Co-Sale Agreement), the
Corporation shall not, by amendment of its Restated Certificate, Bylaws or any of its other governance documents (including but not limited to
the Investor Rights Agreement, the ROFR and Co-Sale Agreement and other agreement governing the rights and obligations of shareholders of
the Corporation), or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed by it hereunder, but shall
at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may reasonably be
requested by the Warrantholder in order to protect the exercise rights of the Warrantholder, consistent with the terms of this Warrant.


15. **Governing Law. This Warrant will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware**

**applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such State. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) to submit to the**
**exclusive personal jurisdiction of the State or Federal courts in the State of Delaware, (b) that exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall lie**
**in the State or Federal courts in the State of Delaware, and (c) that notice may be served upon such party at the address and in the**
**manner set forth for such party in Section 19 hereof. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the parties hereto hereby**
**unconditionally waives trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Warrant.**

16. Binding Effect. This Warrant shall be binding upon any successors or assigns of the Corporation.


17. Equitable Relief. Each party hereto acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by it of any of its obligations under this

Warrant would give rise to irreparable harm to the other party for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and hereby agrees
that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such party of any such obligations, the other party shall, in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a restraining order, an

case, only with the written consent of the Corporation and the Warrantholder. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.


19. Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party to the other will be in writing and

will be deemed to have been duly given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, or by facsimile, upon confirmation of receipt, or (b) on
