## ReportWiz, An Intelligent Business Reporting Assistant

**ReportWiz** is a chatbot that is connected to a repository of existing reports that have been produced, and to the in-house datamarts that contain the company's business-relevant data. 

It takes requests for information from business users and intelligently decides what to do. 

- If there is already a report, it points the user to the existing report. 
- If the report does not exist, it generates the required SQL code to give the requested information to the user. 
- And finally, if it is not able to get the information requested, it creates a structured request  that will be dispatched to the business analytics department so that a report can be produced and added to the repository.

By enabling business users to use natural language to express what they need and retrieve the requested information (in the format of existing reports or SQL queries directly to the database), we can significantly reduce dependency on developers, streamline reporting processes, and improve overall productivity.
